              I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
            I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
            The entire curriculum and staff
            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
            The agile project, in particular, was outstanding.
            It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
            could ever have.
            In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
            experience.
            It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
            100% recommend! ”</p>
